- Bertrand Russell wrote that ‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’. [Page - 32]
- A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile. [Page - 44]
- ‘Want,’ she told her, in a measured tone, ‘is an interesting word. It means lack. Sometimes if we fill that lack with something else the original want disappears entirely. [Page - 58]
- Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .’ She searched for the appropriate term and found it. ‘A load of bullshit.’ the only way to learn is to live.’ [Page - 63]
- The more focused you were on the activity, the less focused you were on everything else. You kind of stopped being you and became the thing you were doing. [Page - 68]
- ‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things,’ Mrs Elm said. ‘You must always remember that.’ [Page - 82]
- ‘If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you. Aim to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don’t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise. Keep your head down. Keep your stamina. [Page - 89]
- ‘Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves.’ [Page - 100]
- The lonely mind in the busy city yearns for connection because it thinks human-to-human connection is the point of everything. But amid pure nature (or the ‘tonic of wildness’ as Thoreau called it) solitude took on a different character. It became in itself a kind of connection. A connection between herself and the world. And between her and herself. [Page - 122]
- The life of a human, according to the Scottish philosopher David Hume, was of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster. [Page - 135]
- Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.’ [Page - 175]
- ‘There are patterns to life . . . Rhythms. It is so easy, while trapped in just the one life, to imagine that times of sadness or tragedy or failure or fear are a result of that particular existence. That it is a byproduct of living a certain way, rather than simply living. I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.’ [Page - 175]
- ‘We only know what we perceive. Everything we experience is ultimately just our perception of it. “It’s
not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”’ [Page - 215]
- Love and laughter and fear and pain are universal currencies. [Page - 273]
- ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’ [Page - 281]
