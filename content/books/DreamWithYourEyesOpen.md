### Highlights

- In business, as in life, failure can be a stronger motivator than success. Get that failure out of people's minds quickly and focus on moving forward, and you won't see that experience as 'the end of the road'. [Page - XVI]
- Risk isn't about going headlong into situations where the outcome can't be predicted. That's just foolish behavior. Risk means pushing the envelope when others want to take the safe route. Risk means caring more about potential rewards than possible losses. To separate yourself from the crowd, think through the worst-case scenarios as possibilities. If a worst-case scenario does become a reality, be just as willing to move on to bigger and better things. [Page - 5]
- When you open your mind to really seeing and pursuing opportunities, you'll find them. The higher your antenna, the keener your observation skills and your alertness; the more open and curious you are, the more likely you are to find an idea worth pursuing. [Page - 15]
- When in doubt, always ask questions without worrying about what people will say or think. Hell, what's the worst that can happen? They'll say no? Who cares? When you're starting from scratch, you have nothing to lose. [Page - 17]
- Research and  homework are vital, but deep knowledge comes from doing, from getting your hands dirty and from asking the questions others are too afraid or embarrassed to ask. Setting your laser sights the goal and getting to work doesn't allow insecurities or manufactured fears to get in the way of your dream. You can't let that happen. You won't let that happen. [Page -18]
- Few things are as vital for an entrepreneur as confident communication and the ability to stay calm and collected in front of a crowd. [Page - 23]
- Communication for entrepreneurs involves much more than elocution. Communication is a form of currency. And how you choose to use it-the speed at which you understand things, your clarity of thought, and your ability to deliver a strong message, so the audience has no doubt who is leading the show-can boost or burn your business. [Page - 23]
- Attentive and courteous communication breads a healthy corporate culture. [Page - 24]
- You never know when a valuable idea will strike like lightning out of a clear sky. Keep yourself open to the thousand opportunities that present themselves to you daily. [Page - 27]
- Charm for me is the ability to persuade with your tone, your willingness to be inclusive in your engagement with everyone in the room or on the call, and your knack for being clear and articulate with your message. Disarm your audience by always listening keenly to everyone's views and sprinkling some humour into even the most serious situations. [Page - 27]
- When you're starting out in any business, everybody gladly tells you, 'This is how you get things done'. Sure, recognize their experiences. But people tend to give experience more credence than they should and often overestimate the value of free advice. Outsiders follow their instincts and those of their team and colleagues. That's how business get done. If someone, even someone you trust, gives you advice that doesn't make sense, go with your own gut. [Page - 40]
- Tur disruption requires urgency across the long term [Page - 48]
- Good capital will always follow well-articulated focused and thoroughly executed business on high-growth, profitable paths. [Page - 49]
- Today's entrepreneurial winners will be among those who deeply study and understand Indian demographics for their company or their new idea. [Page - 52]
- You're not looking at scale, your really don't need a strategy-for, you're focused on the here and now, not the future. Scale and strategy are inextricably linked. [Page - 61]
- Ambition leads to sacrifices; you can't have one without the other,Those with more ambitious goals will generally be more willing to make sacrifices to reach those goals. [Page - 62]
- Don't get yourself in a desperate, 'must do' situation, and you'll always pay the fair and balanced value. When you don't have to consummate a transaction and have the choice to do so only on good terms, the negotiations are fairly balanced. [Page - 70]
- Trust and credibility are crucial for building strong, long term business relationships and require some give and take. Both sides need to see a win-win situation for the long term. [Page - 70]
- When working with organizations that are clients in one business but competitors in another, strong chinese walls are critical and must be built into your company's culture. [Page - 70]
- Domain knowledge  is important, but some quick steps-building an experienced team, fostering kep alliances and getting a string review process in place-will get you moving forward. [Page - 70]
- Entrepreneurship is a lot like life. Sometimes just asking the right questions presents you with half the solution - in this case, inviting you to see and seize opportunities you otherwise didn't know were in your grasp. That's why you chose to be an entrepreneur in the first place. You're accountable to the people who work for you, your consumers and your investors. And because you understand scale, your vision includes an element of restlessness and an obsession for growth. [Page - 77]
- When your own deep knowledge of a market is low, you become even more dependent on the judgement of teams too close to their projects to be objective. That's a dangerous point for any sector or business. And that's exactly when things tend to go downhill. [Page - 79]
- On of the hardest and most enduring lessons everyone in business learns is that not all great ideas succeed. Plan for failure. Embrace failure. But understand that failure is a comma, not a full stop. You don't fail in life when one thing goes wrong. Tomorrow will still be there, no matter how dire today feels. [Page - 81]
- Understanding and accepting failure now will give you the clarity and the resolve you need to survive the big bumps. No matter who you are, how solid your connections, your financial status, or any of the thousand other factors that determine the success of a business understand one thing: <i>At some point, you're going to fail. And not just once.</i> [Page - 82]
- Insulating yourself against failure doesn't ensure success; it only makes success more elusive. To learn from failure, you have to be able to define it, benchmark it and put it in its proper perspective. [Page - 87]
- Failure isn't always about things going horribly wrong or not to plan. Failure is often about missed opportunities and unfortunate timing, both of which can be life-changing events in the destiny of a company, its employees and its shareholders. [Page - 89]
- No one enjoys setbacks, but bumps in the road beleaguer all of us at some point and contribute to our continued growth as entrepreneurs and leaders. You and your organization can never learn and evolve to the next level without setbacks and failures. It's in your DNA to take risks, make mistakes and even fail, provided you don't repeat andy error in judgement twice. Remember this, and the highs will be even higher and a lot of fun. [Page - 92]
- If failure is the most difficult obstacle for aspiring entrepreneurs, your greatest attribute is your ability and willingness to stay the course. In business, things won't always go your way. People will question your every decision and insist that the direction you've chosen won't allow you to reach your goals. Your competitors will strike mercilessly when they sense a weakness. Staying the course isn't the most complicated business philosophy you'll come across, but it is the Holy Grail of business. [Page - 95]
- Staying the course is a conscious strategy and helps you achieve those goals that would have been out of your reach had you called it a day [Page -98]
- Success comes from thorough preparation and positioning in the early stages; absolute commitment to an idea and laser focus on your goals; the ability to build credibility for you and your team; and the confidence that comes from acting with determination and with a clear, uncluttered mind. [Page -98]
- The secret to working through difficult situations-wether these are wih teachers,rivals,competitors, friends or parents-is to never show that they bother you. Level your gaze beyond the horizon. Life is too short to allow others to make you feel inadequate. [Page - 99]
- In startups and mature business, your ability to spot potential trouble is critical, saving you time, energy and grief in the long run. Lose your focus for a minute, though and those trucks will run you over before you know what's happened. [Page - 107]
- You don't have to be the smartest person in the room to be a great leader, just the one who knows the most about every aspect of your organization and can make decisions based on its best interest. The discipline required is relentless analysis. [Page - 113]
- At all stages of your journey, you need to downplay the idea of luck as a necessary ingredient for building strong businesses. Rather, the real source of success is people who generate their own breaks by working hard and focusing on a goal. [Page - 117]
- A common concern from those not to the manor born is that others have a massive advantage when it comes to starting and growing a business-they  have wealth,no worries and all the freedom in the world to do what they choose! Stop wasting your time worrying about what everyone has and realize that, at more than one stage in your career or business cycle, you'll find yourself in the right place at the right time. Maybe wealth gives one person a leg up on another who has to work hard to score in that first round. But money only helps cushion that start. Wealth in no way ensures success. Life is about the next ten years and more, not just today and the law of averages works for each of us-leaders, professionals, entrepreneurs. [Page - 119]
- Inequality is given. You can take inequality as a challenge, or move on, because it never goes way completely. To be honest, that's not necessarily bad news. [Page - 127]
- Life and business are messy. Neither boils down to a spreadsheet not foreshadows myriad unexpected and unforeseeable twists and turns. People look for perfection that doesn't exist, neat and tidy ways of creating and nurturing business that won't cause them discomfort, but will provide astronomical returns. Exists aren't about giving up, they're about seizing opportunities. If you think you're abandoning anything when you exit a business, you're fooling yourself and forgetting why you became an entrepreneur. [Page - 137]
- In life, as in sports, your second innings will depend a lot upon your first-what you've learnt and absorbed along the way and how you've used, and will use, those learnings moving forward. The mistaken assumption, though, is that a second innings can only be meaningful if you're left a mark or created wealth in your first. Absolutely not!. [Page - 145]
- Time and tide move in strange, shifting, wonderful ways to transform you and your thinking, your priorities and perspectives on life. Once you let your guard down and allow the thoughts to flow, you discover more about where you are, where you want to be and what really excites you. [Page - 146]
