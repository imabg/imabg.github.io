### Notes:

- **Intense Exercise and Gym Workouts**: While exercise is generally beneficial, excessive or very high-intensity workouts, especially without proper guidance and gradual progression, can cause minor tears (dissections) in blood vessels. These tears can lead to clot formation, subsequently triggering a heart attack. This is particularly relevant for individuals pushing their limits without understanding their body's capacity 
- **Smoking**: Smoking is identified as a critical and largely preventable risk factor. Alarmingly, over 90% of young individuals experiencing heart attacks are smokers. The harmful chemicals in cigarettes damage blood vessels, increase blood pressure, and promote plaque buildup, significantly elevating the risk of heart disease
- **Genetic Predisposition (South Asians)**:  points to a genetic predisposition among South Asians that makes them more susceptible to heart disease. This includes a tendency for higher body fat percentage, particularly visceral fat (fat around the organs), and smaller abdominal compartments. This body composition often leads to increased insulin resistance and an elevated risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The "Masala study" is mentioned in this context, focusing on the increased cardiovascular risk in South Asian populations.
- **Unhealthy Lifestyle:**:
  - Working Night Shifts:
    -  Disrupting the natural circadian rhythm through night shifts puts undue stress on the cardiovascular system
  - Lack of Sleep:
    - Insufficient sleep, often exacerbated by excessive screen time, negatively impacts overall health and increases the risk of heart problems 
  - Stress:
    - High levels of stress, common in today's fast-paced world, can contribute to increased blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues 
- **Action plan for Healthy Heart**:
  - *Quit Smoking*: This is unequivocally the most crucial preventable measure, especially for young individuals. Seek support and utilize available resources to quit smoking permanently.
  - *Adopt a Balanced Exercise Routine*: Engage in regular physical activity, but avoid extreme or unsupervised high-intensity workouts, especially if you are new to exercise or have underlying health conditions. Consult with a fitness professional to create a safe and effective exercise plan.
  - *Prioritize a Healthy Diet*: While not extensively detailed, focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Limit processed foods, saturated and unhealthy fats, and excessive sugar and salt intake.
  - *Manage Stress Effectively*: Implement stress-reducing techniques such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercises, spending time in nature, and pursuing hobbies. Seek professional help if stress levels are consistently high and unmanageable.
  - *Ensure Adequate Sleep*: Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. Establish a regular sleep schedule and minimize screen time before bed.
  - *Maintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance*: Avoid overworking and prioritize personal time, relaxation, and activities you enjoy. Be mindful of the strain that working night shifts can place on your heart.
  - *Get Regular Health Checkups*: Undergo routine medical checkups, including blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring. Consider ECGs and stress tests as recommended by your doctor, especially after the age of 40 for males and 45 for females. Individuals with a family history of heart disease or other risk factors should start earlier.
  - *Consider CT Calcium Scoring*: Discuss with your doctor whether a CT calcium scoring test is appropriate for assessing your risk of heart disease.
  - *Learn CPR*: Acquiring knowledge of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) can be life-saving in the event of a cardiac arrest. Consider taking a CPR certification course.
  - *Support Public Access to Defibrillators*: Advocate for the availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places to ensure immediate response during cardiac emergencies.
  - *Seek Immediate Medical Attention for Chest Pain*: Recognize the signs and symptoms of a heart attack (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, pain radiating to the arm or jaw) and seek immediate medical help. The goal is to reach the hospital within the critical 90-minute window.
