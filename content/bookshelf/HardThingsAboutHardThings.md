### Theme

The central theme of "The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers" by Ben Horowitz is the brutal reality of leading a startup and making difficult decisions that don't have clear or comfortable solutions.


### Highlights

- Colin Powell says that leadership is the ability to get someone to follow you even if only out of curiosity. [Page - 5]
- There is one skill that stand out, it's The ability to focus and make the best move when there are no good moves. [Page - 59]
- There may be nothing scarier in business than facing an existential threat. [Page - 89]
- There are only two ways for a manager to improve the output of an employee: Motivation and training. [Page - 110]
- If you don't know what you want, the chances that you'll get it are extremely low. If you have never done the job, how do you know what to want. [Page -124] 
- Is's important to supplement a great product vision with a strong discipline around the metrics, but if you substitute metrics for product vision, you will not get what you want. [Page - 132]
- The right kind of ambition is ambition for the company's success with the executive's own success only coming as a by-product of the company's victory. The wrong kind of ambition is ambition for the executive's personal success regardless of the company's outcome. [Page - 150]
- The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product that's at least ten times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing. Two or three times better will not be good enough to get people to switch to the new thing fast enough or in large enough volume to matter. The second thing that any technology startup must do is to take the market. [Page - 179]
- Keep in mind that it's much easier to add new people to old processes than new processes to old people. [Page - 191]
- Perhaps the most important thing that I learned as an entrepreneur was to focus on what I needed to get right and stop worrying about all the things that I did wrong or might do wrong. [Page - 200]
- In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target.The company's survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission. [Page - 226]
- The CEO doesn't have to be the creator of the vision. Nor does she have to be the creator of the story. But she must be the keeper of the vision and the story. As such, the CEO ensures that the company story is clear and compelling. [Page -237]
- Winning strategies are built on comprehensive knowledge gathered in every interaction the CEO has with an employee, a customer, a partner, or an investor. [Page - 239]
